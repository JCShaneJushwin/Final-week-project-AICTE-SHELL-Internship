MY APPROACH:
Data Collection: Open-source GHG datasets containing industrial, transport, and energy consumption data

Preprocessing: Null value handling, normalization, feature selection

Model Training: Trained multiple regression models including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation: Compared models using MAE, RMSE, and R² score

Export: Saved the final trained models using pickle in .pkl format

Versioning: Uploaded models/ folder to GitHub for version control and deployment-readiness

TECH STACK:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Pickle (.pkl)
Git + GitHub
Streamlit for deployment

OUTCOME:

Achieved XX% R² score (replace with your value) with Random Forest
Exported 2 models: Linear Regression & Random Forest Regressor
Ready-to-deploy .pkl models hosted on GitHub
Built full understanding of ML pipeline from data to deployment

Greenhouse gases such as CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O contribute significantly to global warming. Accurate prediction of GHG emissions is vital for forecasting environmental impact and guiding sustainable practices. This project aims to build models that can estimate emissions based on historical data and relevant indicators.
